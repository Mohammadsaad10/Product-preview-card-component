## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

flex-wrap property in parent container and media queries can be used to make mobile-responsive design.

### Useful resources
- [Example resource ](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
